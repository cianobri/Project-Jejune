POSSIBLE TITLES:
	Sonder : The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passing in the street, 
	has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it.

CHARACTER NAMES:
	Player Character: Aubrey LeCunn.
	Player Companion: Aldin.
	Good AI: Mormo.
	Bad AI: Roko or Basilisk. Rosolisk?

PLOTS POINTS:
1.
	Levi and Ivanka were lovers, killed together in her bunk when something crished them after an altitude drop.
	The Officer character was clearly (subtly) in love with ivanka, and he found them.
	- Why would he have found them? In her room?
	- Maybe he killed them?

	Can this be woven into the main plotline? Does the evil AI promise to restore her? (AGI as deity?)

2.
	Aldin either lives or dies. Route through the endgame depends on which one happened.

3.
	Mormo has different levels of "insanity". You can restore him by doing something? Which helps you?

4.
	The antagonist was maybe sent to examine strange signals from space (why he was given such priority over atmos mission).
	The signal is from some advanced civilization. Catch is its not a message, but an alien AI. This could interact somehow with
	how "sane" Mormo is, e.g. highly insane is easily controlled by the evil AI.

5. 
	Evil AI wants to crash the ship to "release" himself (how would that work?).

6.
	Antagonist is motivated to free the evil AI, because it threatened him with eternal simulated torment, and he is a hardcore
	"rationalist". Basically, Roko's Basilisk.
